WHY BHASH?
BHash - Bringing fast and private transactions and decentralized investment into one place
HASH - the Cryptocurrency of the BHash networks runs on a Xevan blockchain, a cutting edge algorithm used by few coins. This means we are on the cutting edge of blockchain technology offering something new and not just another fork. HASH is seen as a store of value with our masternodes backing this. There is such a limited supply, this means like other commodities, HASH will rise in value. 
Xevan is ASIC resistant, meaning we are able to provide a truly decentralized network. BHash Networks aims to bring a fair system to miners and investors alike.  We will be rolling out our POS masternode network from launch with a fair masternode distrobution system. Not auctions like some projects do, But open to all with the base staking amount being 2000 HASH. 
We believe this system is the best when it comes to the security and integrity of the network as we create an extensive network of around 1000 nodes, securing the blockchain and confirming transactions quickly and efficient. As POW burns lots of energy yearly we hope to move to a completely POS network that is green and efficient.
